        Approach:
        1. Use level-order traversal without extra space, starting from the root.
        2. For each level, connect the left child to the right child, and connect the right child to the next node's left child.
        3. Move to the next level by going to the leftmost node of the current level.

        Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes â€” each node is visited once.
        Space Complexity: O(1), since the tree is modified in place and no extra data structures are used.
